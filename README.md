# **NFT Flow on Ethereum blockchain**

### Demo App
Click [here](https://harishkumarchandra.github.io/Crypto_Puppy/) to launch the CryptoPuppies application.

I am designing a decentralized marketplace which can be further extended to meet specific requirements. 
### **Languages and Tools**
Solidity for Smart contract

Truffle to compile, test and deploy contracts

Ganache-cli, a personal Ethereum blockchain made it easy for us to observe the process and transactions during testing

Web3 to interact with a local or remote ethereum node using HTTP, IPC or websocket

blocknative makes it easy to access wallets and work with every other aspects of Web3

Metamask, crypto wallet allows to store and transact Ethereum or any other ERC tokens

### **Below I describe this project**

This is a marketplace that runs on the blockchain. It allows individuals to list "NFTs" for sale and to purchase them on the website with Ethereum in the Ropsten network. This application is powered by a smart contract on the blockchain which manages the market place. For example it tracks who owns the "NFT" for sale, and it automatically transfers the ownership of it when a transaction is complete.


here is the contract address ```0x9ae7B1d535e82AF09b75E9ADDEBA7239B52498E4```

### **Ropsten Ethereum**

One of our main goals was to be able to run our application on Ropsten Ethereum. Ropsten Ethereum is also known as Ethereum Testnet -- a testing network that runs the same protocol as Ethereum does and is used to testing purposes before deploying on the main network. Using Ropsten to deploy our application allows for greater interactability among users.
